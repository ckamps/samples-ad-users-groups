#  Create Sample Active Directory Users and Groups

This script and sample data set can be used to quickly provision a set of sample users and AD security groups in an Active Directory of your choosing.  The script has been primarily tested against instances of the [AWS Managed Microsoft AD](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/directory_microsoft_ad.html) service, but should also work with self-managed AD instances - possibly with minor tweaks to the script in the area of which parent OU is being used.
